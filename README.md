# SimpleOS
Very simple OS for getting basic grasp of OS concepts, can't run on real machine (at least yet), but demonstrates how things are made in OS development in as simple terms as possible.

## Version 0.0.2
Introduces Read Only Memory (ROM).
Display can display any string, but it can't clear anything.
It just dumps contents of Read Only Memory a few times.

## Version 0.0.1
Introduces Display (Monitor) which shows Hello world and can't even display any other string.
